		<p>
			This data was collected and analyzed under the Marshall Project. Last 40 years’ crime reports from 61 police agencies was collected. 
			These reports contain information on the four major crimes that the FBI classifies as violent — homicide, rape, robbery and assault — in 68 
			police jurisdictions with populations of 250,000 or greater. The rate of crime, per 100,000 residents in the jurisdiction, was calculated
			based on the FBI’s estimated population for that year.</p><p>
			The following visualizations help is answering the questions like <i>Is the crime in America rising or falling?</i> <i>Which cities have a 
			higher crime rate? Which cities are safer?</i> <i>Is there a relation between the time of the year and the crime rate?</i> <i>Is crime
			rate related to the population of the area? Is there a relation between various kinds of crimes?</i> amongst others. In this project, my aim 
			was to experiment with various types of interactive visualizations while answering some interesting questions.<br>
